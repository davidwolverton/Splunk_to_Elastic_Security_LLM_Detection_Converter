  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of the RPM Package Manager with elevated privileges, specifically when it is used to run system commands as root via the `--eval` and `lua:os.execute` options. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions and process metadata. This activity is significant because it indicates a potential privilege escalation attempt, allowing a user to gain root access. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to full system compromise, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and further exploitation of the environment. Converted with OpenAI GPT4-o.",
