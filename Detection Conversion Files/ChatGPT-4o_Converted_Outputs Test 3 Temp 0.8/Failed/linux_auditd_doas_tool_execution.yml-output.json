  "name": "OpenAI GPT4-o Linux Auditd Doas Tool Execution",
  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of the 'doas' tool on a Linux host. This tool allows standard users to perform tasks with root privileges, similar to 'sudo'. The detection leverages data from Linux Auditd, focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity is significant as 'doas' can be exploited by adversaries to gain elevated privileges on a compromised host. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized administrative access, potentially compromising the entire system. Converted with OpenAI GPT4-o.",
