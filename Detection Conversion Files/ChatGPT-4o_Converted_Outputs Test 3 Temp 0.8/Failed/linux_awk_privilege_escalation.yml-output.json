  "description": "The following analytic detects the use of the AWK command with elevated privileges to execute system commands. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, specifically monitoring processes that include \"sudo,\" \"awk,\" and \"BEGIN*system\" in their command lines. This activity is significant because it indicates a potential privilege escalation attempt, where a user could gain root access by executing commands as the root user. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to fully compromise the system, execute arbitrary commands, and maintain persistent control over the affected endpoint. Converted with OpenAI GPT4-o.",
