  "name": "OpenAI GPT4-o Linux Auditd Kernel Module Using Rmmod Utility",
  "description": "The following analytic detects suspicious use of the `rmmod` utility for kernel module removal, which may indicate an attacker attempt to unload critical or security-related kernel modules. The `rmmod` command is used to remove modules from the Linux kernel, and unauthorized use can be a tactic to disable security features, conceal malicious activities, or disrupt system operations. By monitoring for unusual or unauthorized `rmmod` activity, this analytic helps identify potential tampering with kernel modules, enabling security teams to take proactive measures to protect system integrity and security. Converted with OpenAI GPT4-o.",
