  "description": "The following analytic detects attempts to escalate privileges on a Linux system using Docker. It identifies processes where Docker commands are used to mount the root directory or execute shell commands within a container. This detection leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process names, command-line arguments, and parent processes. This activity is significant because it can allow an attacker with Docker privileges to modify critical system files, such as /etc/passwd, to create a superuser. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to full system compromise and persistent unauthorized access. Converted with OpenAI GPT4-o.",
