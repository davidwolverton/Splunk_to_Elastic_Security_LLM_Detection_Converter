  "description": "The following analytic detects the use of the 'find' command with 'sudo' and '-exec' options, which can indicate an attempt to escalate privileges on a Linux system. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs that include command-line arguments. This activity is significant because it can allow a user to execute system commands as root, potentially leading to a root shell. If confirmed malicious, this could enable an attacker to gain full control over the system, leading to severe security breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive data. Converted with OpenAI GPT4-o.",
