  "name": "OpenAI GPT4-o Linux Make Privilege Escalation",
  "description": "The following analytic detects the use of the 'make' command with elevated privileges to execute system commands as root, potentially leading to a root shell. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions that include 'make', '--eval', and 'sudo'. This activity is significant because it indicates a possible privilege escalation attempt, allowing a user to gain root access. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could achieve full control over the system, execute arbitrary commands, and compromise the entire environment. Converted with OpenAI GPT4-o.",
