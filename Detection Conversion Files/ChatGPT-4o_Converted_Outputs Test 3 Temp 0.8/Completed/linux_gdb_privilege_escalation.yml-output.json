  "name": "OpenAI GPT4-o: Linux GDB Privilege Escalation",
  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of the GNU Debugger (GDB) with specific flags that indicate an attempt to escalate privileges on a Linux system. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry to identify processes where GDB is run with the `-nx`, `-ex`, and `sudo` flags. This activity is significant because it can allow a user to execute system commands as root, potentially leading to a root shell. If confirmed malicious, this could result in full system compromise, allowing an attacker to gain complete control over the affected endpoint. Converted with OpenAI GPT4-o.",
