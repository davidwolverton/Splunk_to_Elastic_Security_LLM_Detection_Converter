  "description": "The following analytic detects the deletion of SSL certificates on a Linux machine. It leverages filesystem event logs to identify when files with extensions .pem or .crt are deleted from the /etc/ssl/certs/ directory. This activity is significant because attackers may delete or modify SSL certificates to disable security features or evade defenses on a compromised system. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could indicate an attempt to disrupt secure communications, evade detection, or execute a destructive payload, potentially leading to significant security breaches and data loss. Converted with OpenAI GPT4-o.",
