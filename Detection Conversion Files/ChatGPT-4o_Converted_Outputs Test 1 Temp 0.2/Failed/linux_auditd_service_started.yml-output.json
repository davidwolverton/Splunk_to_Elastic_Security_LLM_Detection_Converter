This behavior is critical for a SOC to monitor because it may indicate attempts to gain unauthorized access or maintain control over a system. Such actions could be signs of malicious activity. If confirmed, this could lead to serious consequences, including a compromised system, unauthorized access to sensitive data, or even a wider breach affecting the entire network. Detecting and responding to these signs early is essential to prevent potential security incidents. Converted with OpenAI GPT4-o.",
