  "name": "OpenAI GPT4-o Linux Java Spawning Shell",
  "description": "The following analytic detects instances where Java, Apache, or Tomcat processes spawn a Linux shell, which may indicate exploitation attempts, such as those related to CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell). This detection leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process names and parent-child process relationships. This activity is significant as it can signify a compromised Java application, potentially leading to unauthorized shell access. If confirmed malicious, attackers could execute arbitrary commands, escalate privileges, or maintain persistent access, posing a severe threat to the environment. Converted with OpenAI GPT4-o.",
