  "description": "The following analytic detects suspicious command lines that append user entries to /etc/at.allow or /etc/at.deny files. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions involving these files. This activity is significant because altering these configuration files can allow attackers to schedule tasks with elevated permissions, facilitating persistence on a compromised Linux host. If confirmed malicious, this could enable attackers to execute arbitrary code at scheduled intervals, potentially leading to further system compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
