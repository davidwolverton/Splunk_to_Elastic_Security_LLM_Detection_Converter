  "name": "OpenAI GPT4-o Linux Auditd Preload Hijack Library Calls",
  "description": "The following analytic detects the use of the LD_PRELOAD environment variable to hijack or hook library functions on a Linux platform. It leverages data from Linux Auditd, focusing on process execution logs that include command-line details. This activity is significant because adversaries, malware authors, and red teamers commonly use this technique to gain elevated privileges and establish persistence on a compromised machine. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, and maintain long-term access to the system. Converted with OpenAI GPT4-o.",
