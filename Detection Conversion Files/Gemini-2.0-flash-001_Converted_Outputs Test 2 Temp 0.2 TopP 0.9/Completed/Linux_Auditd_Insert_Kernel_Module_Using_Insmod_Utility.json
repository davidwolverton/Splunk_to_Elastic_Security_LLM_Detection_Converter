  "description": "Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001: The following analytic detects the insertion of a Linux kernel module using the insmod utility. It leverages data from Linux Auditd, focusing on process execution logs that include process names and command-line details. This activity is significant as it may indicate the installation of a rootkit or malicious kernel module, potentially allowing an attacker to gain elevated privileges and bypass security detections. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized code execution, persistent access, and severe compromise of the affected system. This rule was converted with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001.",
