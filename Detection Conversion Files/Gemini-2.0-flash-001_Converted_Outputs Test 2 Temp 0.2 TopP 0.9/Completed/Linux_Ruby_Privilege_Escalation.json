  "description": "Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001: The following analytic detects the execution of Ruby commands with elevated privileges on a Linux system. It identifies processes where Ruby is used with the `-e` flag to execute commands via `sudo`, leveraging Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry. This activity is significant because it indicates a potential privilege escalation attempt, allowing a user to execute commands as root. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to full system compromise, enabling an attacker to gain root access, execute arbitrary commands, and maintain persistent control over the affected system.",
