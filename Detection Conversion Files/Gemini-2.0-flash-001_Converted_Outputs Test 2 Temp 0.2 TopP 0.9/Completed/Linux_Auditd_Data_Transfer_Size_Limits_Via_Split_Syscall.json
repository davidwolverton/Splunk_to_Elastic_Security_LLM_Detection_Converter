  "description": "Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001: The following analytic detects suspicious data transfer activities that involve the use of the `split` syscall, potentially indicating an attempt to evade detection by breaking large files into smaller parts. Attackers may use this technique to bypass size-based security controls, facilitating the covert exfiltration of sensitive data. By monitoring for unusual or unauthorized use of the `split` syscall, this analytic helps identify potential data exfiltration attempts, allowing security teams to intervene and prevent the unauthorized transfer of critical information from the network. This rule was converted with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001.",
