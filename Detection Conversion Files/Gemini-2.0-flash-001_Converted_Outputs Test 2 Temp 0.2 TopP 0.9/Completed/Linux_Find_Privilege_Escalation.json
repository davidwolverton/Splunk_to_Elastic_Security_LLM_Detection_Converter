  "description": "Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001: The following analytic detects the use of the 'find' command with 'sudo' and '-exec' options, which can indicate an attempt to escalate privileges on a Linux system. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs that include command-line arguments. This activity is significant because it can allow a user to execute system commands as root, potentially leading to a root shell. If confirmed malicious, this could enable an attacker to gain full control over the system, leading to severe security breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive data.",
