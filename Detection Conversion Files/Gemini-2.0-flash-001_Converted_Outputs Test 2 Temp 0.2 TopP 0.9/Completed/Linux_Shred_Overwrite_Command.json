It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line arguments. This activity is significant because the 'shred' command can be used in destructive attacks, such as those seen in the Industroyer2 malware targeting energy facilities. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to the permanent destruction of critical files, severely impacting system integrity and data availability.\n\nRule converted with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001",
