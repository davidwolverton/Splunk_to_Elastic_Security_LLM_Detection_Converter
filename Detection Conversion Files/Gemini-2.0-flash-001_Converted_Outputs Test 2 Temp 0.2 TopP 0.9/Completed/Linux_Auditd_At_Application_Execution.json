This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and parent process names associated with \"at\" or \"atd\". This activity is significant because the \"At\" application can be exploited to maintain unauthorized access or deliver additional malicious payloads. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to data theft, ransomware attacks, or other severe consequences. Immediate investigation is required to determine the legitimacy of the execution and mitigate potential risks. This rule was converted with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001.",
