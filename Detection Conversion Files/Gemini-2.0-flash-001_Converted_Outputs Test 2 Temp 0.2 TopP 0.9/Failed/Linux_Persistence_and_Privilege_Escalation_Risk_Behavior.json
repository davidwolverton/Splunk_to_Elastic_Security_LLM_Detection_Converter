  "description": "Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001: The following analytic identifies potential Linux persistence and privilege escalation activities. It leverages risk scores and event counts from various Linux-related data sources, focusing on tactics associated with persistence and privilege escalation. This activity is significant for a SOC because it highlights behaviors that could allow an attacker to maintain access or gain elevated privileges on a Linux system. If confirmed malicious, this activity could enable an attacker to execute code with higher privileges, persist in the environment, and potentially access sensitive information, posing a severe security risk.",

The correlation relies on more than x amount of distinct detection names generated before generating a finding. Modify the value as needed. Default value is set to 4. This value may need to be increased based on activity in your environment.",
