  "description": "Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001: The following analytic detects the creation of suspicious service files\nwithin the systemd directories on Linux platforms. It leverages logs containing\nfile name, file path, and process GUID data from endpoints. This activity is significant\nfor a SOC as it may indicate an adversary attempting to establish persistence on\na compromised host. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to system compromise\nor data exfiltration, allowing attackers to maintain control over the system and\nexecute further malicious activities.",
  "enabled": true,
  "false_positives": [
    "False positives may arise when administrators or network operators create files in systemd directories for legitimate automation tasks. Therefore, it's important to adjust filter macros to account for valid activities. To implement this search successfully, it's crucial to ingest appropriate logs, preferably using the Linux Sysmon Add-on from Splunkbase for those using Sysmon."
