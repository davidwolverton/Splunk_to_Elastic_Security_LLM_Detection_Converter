  "description": "Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001: The following analytic detects the execution of the 'csvtool' command with 'sudo' privileges, which can allow a user to run system commands as root. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs that include command-line details. This activity is significant because it indicates a potential privilege escalation attempt, where a user could gain unauthorized root access. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to full system compromise, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, escalate privileges, and maintain persistent access.",
