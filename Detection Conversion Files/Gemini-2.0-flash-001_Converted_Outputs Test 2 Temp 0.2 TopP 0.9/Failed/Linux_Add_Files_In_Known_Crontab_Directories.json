  "description": "Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001: The following analytic detects unauthorized file creation in known crontab directories on Unix-based systems. It leverages filesystem data to identify new files in directories such as /etc/cron* and /var/spool/cron/*. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt by threat actors or malware to establish persistence on a compromised host. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code at scheduled intervals, potentially leading to further system compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive information.",
