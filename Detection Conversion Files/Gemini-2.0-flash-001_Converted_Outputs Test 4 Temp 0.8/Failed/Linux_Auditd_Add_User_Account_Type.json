Such actions could be signs of malicious activity. If confirmed, this could lead to serious consequences, including a compromised system, unauthorized access to sensitive data, or even a wider breach affecting the entire network. Detecting and responding to these signs early is essential to prevent potential security incidents.\n\n### Why\nDetecting suspicious add user account activity is crucial for identifying potential unauthorized access attempts, privilege escalation, or persistence mechanisms employed by threat actors. Early detection allows security teams to respond promptly, mitigating the risk of a full-scale compromise.\n",
