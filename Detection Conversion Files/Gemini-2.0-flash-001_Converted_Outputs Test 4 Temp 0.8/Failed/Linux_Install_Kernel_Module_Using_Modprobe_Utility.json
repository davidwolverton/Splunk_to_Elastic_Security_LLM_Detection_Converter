It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity is significant because installing a kernel module can indicate an attempt to deploy a rootkit or other malicious kernel-level code, potentially leading to elevated privileges and bypassing security detections. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to gain persistent, high-level access to the system, compromising its integrity and security.  Rule converted with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001.",
