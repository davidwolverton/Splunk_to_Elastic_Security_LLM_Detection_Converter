  "description": "Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001: The following analytic detects the execution of the GNU Debugger (GDB) with specific flags that indicate an attempt to escalate privileges on a Linux system. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry to identify processes where GDB is run with the `-nx`, `-ex`, and `sudo` flags. This activity is significant because it can allow a user to execute system commands as root, potentially leading to a root shell. If confirmed malicious, this could result in full system compromise, allowing an attacker to gain complete control over the affected endpoint.",

    "how_to_implement": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process."
