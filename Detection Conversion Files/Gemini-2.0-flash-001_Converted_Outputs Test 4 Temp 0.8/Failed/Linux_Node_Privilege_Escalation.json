  "description": "Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001: The following analytic identifies the execution of Node.js with elevated privileges using sudo, specifically when spawning child processes. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions that include specific Node.js commands. This activity is significant because running Node.js as a superuser without dropping privileges can allow unauthorized access to the file system and potential privilege escalation. If confirmed malicious, this could enable an attacker to maintain privileged access, execute arbitrary code, and compromise sensitive data within the environment.",
