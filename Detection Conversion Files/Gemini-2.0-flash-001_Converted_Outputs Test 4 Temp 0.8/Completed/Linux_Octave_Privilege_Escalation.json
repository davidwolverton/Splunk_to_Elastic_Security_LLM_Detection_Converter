  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of GNU Octave with elevated\nprivileges, specifically when it runs system commands via sudo. It leverages data\nfrom Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process command-line\narguments that include \"octave-cli,\" \"--eval,\" \"system,\" and \"sudo.\" This activity\nis significant because it indicates a potential privilege escalation attempt, allowing\na user to execute commands as root. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to full\nsystem compromise, enabling an attacker to gain root access and execute arbitrary\ncommands, severely impacting system security and integrity.\n\nThis rule was converted with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001.",

  "note": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection\nand Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related\ntelemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,\nyou must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.\nAdditionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must\nbe processed using the appropriate Elastic Technology Add-ons that are specific to\nthe EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the appropriate ECS fields.",
