This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process command-line arguments and execution details.\n  This activity is significant because it indicates a potential privilege escalation attempt, allowing a user to execute system commands as root. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to full system compromise, enabling an attacker to gain root access and execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.\n  This rule was converted with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001",
