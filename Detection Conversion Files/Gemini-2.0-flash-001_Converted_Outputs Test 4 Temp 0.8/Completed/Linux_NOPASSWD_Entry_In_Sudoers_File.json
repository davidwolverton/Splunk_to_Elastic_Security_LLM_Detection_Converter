It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response\n(EDR) telemetry to identify command lines containing \"NOPASSWD:\". This activity\nis significant because it allows users to execute commands with elevated privileges\nwithout requiring a password, which can be exploited by adversaries to maintain\npersistent, privileged access. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized\nprivilege escalation, persistent access, and potential compromise of sensitive data\nand system integrity.
