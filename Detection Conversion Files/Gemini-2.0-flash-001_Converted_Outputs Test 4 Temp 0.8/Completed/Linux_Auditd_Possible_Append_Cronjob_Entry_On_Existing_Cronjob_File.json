  "description": "Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001: The following analytic detects potential tampering with cronjob files\n  on a Linux system by identifying 'echo' commands that append code to existing cronjob\n  files. It leverages logs from Linux Auditd, focusing on process names, parent processes,\n  and command-line executions. This activity is significant because adversaries often\n  use it for persistence or privilege escalation. If confirmed malicious, this could\n  allow attackers to execute unauthorized code automatically, leading to system compromises\n  and unauthorized data access, thereby impacting business operations and data integrity.",

    "False positives may arise from legitimate actions by administrators or network operators who may use these commands for automation purposes. Therefore, it's recommended to adjust filter macros to eliminate such false positives."
