  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of the RubyGems utility with elevated privileges, specifically when it is used to run system commands as root. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions that include \"gem open -e\" and \"sudo\". This activity is significant because it indicates a potential privilege escalation attempt, allowing a user to execute commands as the root user. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to full system compromise, enabling the attacker to gain root access and execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.\n\nNote: This rule was converted with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001.",

  "note": "### How To Implement\nThe detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.\n\n### References\n* https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/gem/\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems",
