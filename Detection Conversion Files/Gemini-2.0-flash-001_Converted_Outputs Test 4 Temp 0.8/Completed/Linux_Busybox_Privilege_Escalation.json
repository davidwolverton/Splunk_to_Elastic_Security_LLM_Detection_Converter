  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of BusyBox with sudo privileges, which can lead to privilege escalation on Linux systems. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process creation events where BusyBox is executed with both 'sh' and 'sudo' commands. This activity is significant because it indicates a user may be attempting to gain root access, bypassing standard security controls. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root, leading to full system compromise and potential persistence within the environment. This rule was converted with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001.",

  "note": "### How to implement\nThe detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.\n\n### References\n- https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/busybox/\n- https://man.archlinux.org/man/busybox.1.en",
