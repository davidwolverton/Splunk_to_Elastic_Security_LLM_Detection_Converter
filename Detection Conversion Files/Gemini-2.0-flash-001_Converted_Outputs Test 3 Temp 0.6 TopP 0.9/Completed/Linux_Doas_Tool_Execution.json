  "description": "Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001: The following analytic detects the execution of the 'doas' tool on a\n  Linux host. This tool allows standard users to perform tasks with root privileges,\n  similar to 'sudo'. The detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response\n  (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity\n  is significant as 'doas' can be exploited by adversaries to gain elevated privileges\n  on a compromised host. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized administrative\n  access, potentially compromising the entire system. Converted with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001",

To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions.",
