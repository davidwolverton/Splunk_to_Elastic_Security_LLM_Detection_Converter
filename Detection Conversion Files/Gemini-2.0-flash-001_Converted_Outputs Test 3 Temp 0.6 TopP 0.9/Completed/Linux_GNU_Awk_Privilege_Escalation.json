  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of the 'gawk' command with\nelevated privileges on a Linux system. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response\n(EDR) telemetry to identify command-line executions where 'gawk' is used with 'sudo'\nand 'BEGIN{system' patterns. This activity is significant because it indicates a\npotential privilege escalation attempt, allowing a user to execute system commands\nas root. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to full root access, enabling the\nattacker to control the system, modify critical files, and maintain persistent access.\nRule converted with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001",

  "note": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection\n  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related\n  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,\n  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.\n  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must\n  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to\n  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`\n  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field\n  names and speed up the data modeling process.",
