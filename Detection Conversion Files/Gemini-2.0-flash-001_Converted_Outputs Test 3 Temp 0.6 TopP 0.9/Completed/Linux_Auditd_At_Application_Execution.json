  "description": "Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001: The following analytic detects the execution of the \"At\" application\nin Linux, which can be used by attackers to create persistence entries on a compromised\nhost. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,\nfocusing on process names and parent process names associated with \"at\" or \"atd\".\nThis activity is significant because the \"At\" application can be exploited to maintain\nunauthorized access or deliver additional malicious payloads. If confirmed malicious,\nthis behavior could lead to data theft, ransomware attacks, or other severe consequences.\nImmediate investigation is required to determine the legitimacy of the execution\nand mitigate potential risks.",
