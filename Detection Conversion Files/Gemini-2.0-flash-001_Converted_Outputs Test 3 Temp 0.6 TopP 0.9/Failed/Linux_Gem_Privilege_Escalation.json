This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions that include \"gem open -e\" and \"sudo\". This activity is significant because it indicates a potential privilege escalation attempt, allowing a user to execute commands as the root user. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to full system compromise, enabling the attacker to gain root access and execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.

This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions that include \"gem open -e\" and \"sudo\". This activity is significant because it indicates a potential privilege escalation attempt, allowing a user to execute commands as the root user. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to full system compromise, enabling the attacker to gain root access and execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.\n\n## Why\nAttackers may attempt to use RubyGems to escalate privileges on a Linux system.\n\n## Example\nAn attacker uses `gem open -e` and `sudo` to execute commands as the root user.\n\n## False Positives\nFalse positives may be present, filter as needed.\n\n## Response\nIf confirmed malicious, this could lead to full system compromise, enabling the attacker to gain root access and execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.",
