  "description": "Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001: The following analytic detects the execution of MySQL commands with elevated privileges using sudo, which can lead to privilege escalation. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs that include command-line details. This activity is significant because it indicates a potential misuse of MySQL to execute system commands as root, which could allow an attacker to gain root shell access. If confirmed malicious, this could result in full control over the affected system, leading to severe security breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive data.

    "how_to_implement": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
