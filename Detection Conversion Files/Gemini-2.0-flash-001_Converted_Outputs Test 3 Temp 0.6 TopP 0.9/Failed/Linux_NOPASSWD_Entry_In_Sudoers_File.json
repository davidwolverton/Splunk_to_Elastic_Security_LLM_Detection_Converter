  "description": "Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001: The following analytic detects the addition of NOPASSWD entries to the /etc/sudoers file on Linux systems. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry to identify command lines containing \"NOPASSWD:\". This activity is significant because it allows users to execute commands with elevated privileges without requiring a password, which can be exploited by adversaries to maintain persistent, privileged access. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized privilege escalation, persistent access, and potential compromise of sensitive data and system integrity. This rule was converted with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001.",

  "note": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
