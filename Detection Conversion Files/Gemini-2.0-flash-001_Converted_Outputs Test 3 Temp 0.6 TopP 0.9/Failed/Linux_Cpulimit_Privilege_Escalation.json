  "description": "Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001: The following analytic detects the use of the 'cpulimit' command with specific flags ('-l', '-f') executed with 'sudo' privileges. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process command-line arguments and execution details. This activity is significant because if 'cpulimit' is granted sudo rights, a user can potentially execute system commands as root, leading to privilege escalation. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to gain root access, execute arbitrary commands, and fully compromise the affected system. This rule was converted with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001.",

These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions.",
