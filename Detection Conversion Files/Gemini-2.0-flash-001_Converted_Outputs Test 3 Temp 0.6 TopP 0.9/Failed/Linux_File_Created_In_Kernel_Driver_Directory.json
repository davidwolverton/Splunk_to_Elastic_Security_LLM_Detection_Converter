  "description": "Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001: The following analytic detects the creation of files in the Linux kernel/driver directory. It leverages filesystem data to identify new files in this critical directory. This activity is significant because the kernel/driver directory is typically reserved for kernel modules, and unauthorized file creation here can indicate a rootkit installation. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to gain high-level privileges, potentially compromising the entire system by executing code at the kernel level.",
