It leverages logs from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing\n  on process names, parent processes, and command-line executions. This activity is\n  significant because adversaries often use it for persistence or privilege escalation.\n  If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute unauthorized code\n  automatically, leading to system compromises and unauthorized data access, thereby\n  impacting business operations and data integrity.\n  This rule was converted with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001.",
