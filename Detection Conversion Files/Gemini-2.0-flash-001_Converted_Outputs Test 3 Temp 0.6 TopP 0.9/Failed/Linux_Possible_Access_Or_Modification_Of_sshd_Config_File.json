  "description": "Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001: The following analytic detects suspicious access or modification of the sshd_config file on Linux systems. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions involving processes like \"cat,\" \"nano,\" \"vim,\" and \"vi\" accessing the sshd_config file. This activity is significant because unauthorized changes to sshd_config can allow threat actors to redirect port connections or use unauthorized keys, potentially compromising the system. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or persistent backdoor access, posing a severe security risk.  This rule was converted with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001.",

These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions.",
