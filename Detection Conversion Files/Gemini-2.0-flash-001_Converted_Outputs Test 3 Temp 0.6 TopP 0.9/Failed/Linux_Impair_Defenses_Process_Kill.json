  "description": "Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001: The following analytic identifies the execution of the 'pkill' command, which is used to terminate processes on a Linux system. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity is significant because threat actors often use 'pkill' to disable security defenses or terminate critical processes, facilitating further malicious actions. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to the disruption of security applications, enabling attackers to evade detection and potentially corrupt or destroy files on the targeted system.\nConverted with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001",

  "note": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Elastic integrations that are specific to the EDR product.",
