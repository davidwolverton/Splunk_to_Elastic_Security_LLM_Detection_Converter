  "description": "Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001: The following analytic detects the execution of GNU Octave with elevated privileges, specifically when it runs system commands via sudo. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process command-line arguments that include \"octave-cli,\" \"--eval,\" \"system,\" and \"sudo.\" This activity is significant because it indicates a potential privilege escalation attempt, allowing a user to execute commands as root. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to full system compromise, enabling an attacker to gain root access and execute arbitrary commands, severely impacting system security and integrity. This rule was converted with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001.",

To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions.",
