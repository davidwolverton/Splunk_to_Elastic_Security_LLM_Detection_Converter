  "description": "Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001: The following analytic detects the creation of SSH key files in the ~/.ssh/ directory. It leverages filesystem data to identify new files in this specific path. This activity is significant because threat actors often create SSH keys to gain persistent access and escalate privileges on a compromised host. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to remotely access the machine using the OpenSSH daemon service, leading to potential unauthorized control and data exfiltration. This rule was converted with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001.",
