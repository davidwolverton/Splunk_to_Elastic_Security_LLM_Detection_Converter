  "description": "Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001: The following analytic detects processes that clear or free page cache on a Linux system. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data, focusing on specific command-line executions involving the kernel system request `drop_caches`. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to delete forensic evidence or the presence of wiper malware like Awfulshred. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow an attacker to cover their tracks, making it difficult to investigate other malicious activities or system compromises. This rule was converted with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001",

These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions.",
