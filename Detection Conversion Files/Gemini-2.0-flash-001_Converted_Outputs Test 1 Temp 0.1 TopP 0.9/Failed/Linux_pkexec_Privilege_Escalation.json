  "description": "Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001: The following analytic detects the execution of `pkexec` without any command-line arguments. This behavior leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process telemetry. The significance lies in the fact that this pattern is associated with the exploitation of CVE-2021-4034 (PwnKit), a critical vulnerability in Polkit's pkexec component. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to gain full root privileges on the affected Linux system, leading to complete system compromise and potential unauthorized access to sensitive information. Converted with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001.",

  "note": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Elastic integrations that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the Elastic Common Schema (ECS).",
