It identifies this activity by monitoring command-line executions involving 'crontab' and the edit parameter. This behavior is significant for a SOC as cron job manipulations can indicate unauthorized persistence attempts or scheduled malicious actions. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to system compromise, unauthorized access, or broader network compromise. This rule was converted with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash 001",
