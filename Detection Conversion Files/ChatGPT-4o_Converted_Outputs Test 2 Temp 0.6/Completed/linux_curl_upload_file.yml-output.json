  "description": "The following analytic detects the use of the curl command with specific switches (-F, --form, --upload-file, -T, -d, --data, --data-raw, -I, --head) to upload AWS credentials or configuration files to a remote destination. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions and process details. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to exfiltrate sensitive AWS credentials, a technique known to be used by the TeamTNT group. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access and potential compromise of AWS resources. Converted with OpenAI GPT4-o.",
