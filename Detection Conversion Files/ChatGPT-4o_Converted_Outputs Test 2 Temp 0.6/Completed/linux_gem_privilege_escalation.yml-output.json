  "name": "OpenAI GPT4-o Linux Gem Privilege Escalation",
  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of the RubyGems utility with elevated privileges, specifically when it is used to run system commands as root. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions that include \"gem open -e\" and \"sudo\". This activity is significant because it indicates a potential privilege escalation attempt, allowing a user to execute commands as the root user. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to full system compromise, enabling the attacker to gain root access and execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges. Converted with OpenAI GPT4-o.",
