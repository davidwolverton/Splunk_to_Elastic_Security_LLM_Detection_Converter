  "description": "The following analytic detects suspicious stopping of the `osquery` service, which may indicate an attempt to disable monitoring and evade detection. `Osquery` is a powerful tool used for querying system information and detecting anomalies, and stopping its service can be a sign that an attacker is trying to disrupt security monitoring or hide malicious activities. By monitoring for unusual or unauthorized stops of the `osquery` service, this analytic helps identify potential efforts to bypass security controls, enabling security teams to investigate and respond to possible threats effectively. Converted with OpenAI GPT4-o.",
