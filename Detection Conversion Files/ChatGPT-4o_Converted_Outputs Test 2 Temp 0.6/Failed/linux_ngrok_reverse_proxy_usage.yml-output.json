  "name": "OpenAI GPT4-o Linux Ngrok Reverse Proxy Usage",
  "description": "The following analytic detects the use of Ngrok on a Linux operating system. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line arguments associated with Ngrok. This activity is significant because Ngrok can be used by adversaries to establish reverse proxies, potentially bypassing network defenses. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to create persistent, unauthorized access channels, facilitating data exfiltration or further exploitation of the compromised system. Converted with OpenAI GPT4-o.",
