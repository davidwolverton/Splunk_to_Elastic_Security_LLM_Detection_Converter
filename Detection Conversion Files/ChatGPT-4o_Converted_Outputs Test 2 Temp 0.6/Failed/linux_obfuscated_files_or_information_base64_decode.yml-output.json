  "description": "The following analytic detects the use of the base64 decode command on Linux systems, which is often used to deobfuscate files. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions that include \"base64 -d\" or \"base64 --decode\". This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to hide malicious payloads or scripts. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could use this technique to execute hidden code, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or further system compromise. Converted with OpenAI GPT4-o.",
