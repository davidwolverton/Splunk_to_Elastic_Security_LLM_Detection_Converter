  "description": "The following analytic detects potential access or modification of the /etc/sudoers file on a Linux system. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on processes like \"cat,\" \"nano,\" \"vim,\" and \"vi\" accessing the /etc/sudoers file. This activity is significant because the sudoers file controls user permissions for executing commands with elevated privileges. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain persistence or escalate privileges, compromising the security of the targeted host. Converted with OpenAI GPT4-o.",
